## Deliverables 

- This project is a blend of HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API.

- It runs on a single page and all interactions between the client and API are handled asynchronously while using JSON as the communication format.

- This application works in a simple way:

1. It uses a fetch request to GET a list of Breweries to display.

2. You are able to click on any of the breweries listed and it will populate information pertaining to that specific brewery.

3. The button function at the top allows you to reset and show the entire list of breweries again.
